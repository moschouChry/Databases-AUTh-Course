# Databases Auth Course - HikeTheDayDB
<p>
This is the group assignment of the course Databases (AUTh, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - 9th semester). The goal is to create a relational database.
</p>
<h2>HikeTheDayDB</h2>
<p>
Our team designed a relational database that would support a hiking application. The main function of the application would be to provide information about hiking routes, trails and refugges in Greece. Furthermore, a user could create an account to book an excursion with a certified guide of the app. Additional functionality of the database includes informing the hiker about the necessary equipment for a certain route<br>
</p>

<h2>hikeTheDay.mwb</h2>
<p>
Database model in MySQL Workbench format.
</p>

<h2>hikethedaydump.sql</h2>
<p>
SQL script that contains the dump for creating the database (tables, constraints, inserted data, views).
</p>

<h2>users.sql</h2>
<p>
SQL script for creating the users of the database and their rights.
</p>

<h2>query1.sql, query2.sql, ... , query12.sql</h2>
<p>
SQL scripts that include queries to the database.
